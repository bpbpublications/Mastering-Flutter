## About the Book
Mastering Flutter is ideal for the developer at the beginner level as well as the developer who wants to switch to Flutter. This book starts at the beginner level so that you know everything you need to create apps that can be published in different mobile stores. You will develop a movie app that is beautiful, has animations, uses a movie API to get the latest movie information and uses Firebase to store user information.

Learn Flutter app development from the ground up, starting with the basics of Flutter and Dart code. By creating a movie app, you will master building user interfaces, managing data, and adding different screens. You will make your app look great with custom designs and smooth animations. The app will connect to the internet, save data locally, and use Firebase to handle user accounts and send notifications. You will also learn how to make your app work on websites and computers, respond to user actions, and add extra features from Flutter's package library. The final steps cover testing your app, making it run faster, and getting it ready for users to download.

Finally, you will learn how to publish your apps on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, starting your career as a mobile developer. You will be able to create websites and desktop applications of the same app.
